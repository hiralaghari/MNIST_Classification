# MNIST Classification with TensorFlow

This project is focused on learning the basics of TensorFlow and neural networks through the MNIST classification problem. The repository includes code, notes, and explanations to help understand how to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a convolutional neural network.
- **Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Key Learning Areas**:
  - Building a CNN architecture
  - Understanding layers, batch size, and epochs
  - Compiling and training the model
  - Monitoring performance using validation data

This project is designed as a stepping stone for beginners to get hands-on experience with TensorFlow and neural networks.
